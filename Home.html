<h1> Company Profile </h1>
<p> From the very beginning of its establishment the professionals used to be involved in energy efficient building design and use of alternative energy in its design works. Now the firm has established itself as pioneer in Green Building Design. Kathmandu is going to achieve LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environment Design) accreditation by US Green Building Council. The firm is also pioneer in production of 3D rendered images and animation of building as well as interior design projects.
<br><br/>
During the mid-eighties in Nepal, it was a taboo for fresh graduates to start their own firm. But a group of architects and engineers, freshly graduated from various universities of former Soviet Union, ventured into this forbidden realm and established 'Innovative Createers' specializing in Architectural and Interior Design. With innovative and creative approach to every design problem, the firm has experiences of designing Mega Scale Planning and Designing like Gongabu Bus Park Extension Project at Gongabu, Kathmandu, industrial buildings like the Kathmandu Full Site Development Project of Coca-Cola Company at Balaju, Kathmandu, hospital building like Tilganga Eye Centre (funded by USAID) at Gaushala, Kathmandu and showroom cum corporate office building of Sirpadi Trading Pvt Ltd (TATA Motors) at Thapathali, Kathmandu. The Firm is also familiar with designing buildings in rural and remote areas like Khotang and Solukumbu. It has toddled with designing low cost buildings utilizing only local materials as well as designing with state-of-the-art construction materials and modern technology.
<br><br/>

At very beginning of the establishment, the firm was awarded with the Project of design and construction supervision of Balkumari Multiple Campus at Narayangarh. As the construction works came to the end, grandeur of social endeavor began to be realized by the people of Narayangarh and the Chamber of Commerce and Industries of Narayangarh requested the firm to design and construction supervise their office building with auditorium and apartment blocks. At this stage, the firm had already acquired confidence in business and earned the trust of the people hence making CREATEERS a rapidly growing Consultant of late eighties. The early nineties opened even wider horizon to the CREATEERS with more prestigious projects like Office Complex for Bagmati Watershed Project at Babarmahal (funded by the European Union). The design was selected from a number of design proposals submitted by different architectural firms. Another saga during early nineties in the history of CREATEERS was its involvement in the design work of five star hotels, The Blue Bird Hotel at Pokhara. The mid nineties projects like Naya Bazar Land Pooling Project (ADB funded Project), Factory Complex for Jyoti Ceramics at Panchkhal gave further thrust to the firm to work in various sectors and different geographic region.
<br><br/>

With the dawn of the new millennium, the firm has achieved new heights with number of remarkable Architectural Designing of Corporate Office and Commercial Buildings. The Firm got the opportunity of Design & supervision of City Office Complex for Nepal Airlines Corporation (NAC) at Nepalgunj and Biratnagar, Corporate Office Building of Nepal Airlines Corporation (NAC) at Sinamangal, Kathmandu, Department of Electricity Development (DoED) at Sano Gauchar, Kathmandu. Then, the Firm was awarded with another prestigious project of Architectural and Interior Design of Regional Education Directorate Office Complexes (Jointly financed by GoN/ ADB and DANIDA) of all five regions and District Education Offices at 9 districts (Jointly financed by GoN/ IDA, DANIDA, DFID and Govt. of Finland). In design works of the Central Regional Educational Directorate at Hetauda, the Solar energy is used not only for heating the office rooms but for cooling of the office spaces.
<br><br/>

Besides involvement in Architectural Designing, the Firm designed and supervised various interior projects with further ease and efficiency. Recently we have completed a  turnkey project of "Interior Refurbishment of Shangri-La Casino and construction of Lift area, Pathway and Connection bridge" at Lazimpat. The firm is proud to mention that the Project worth of about NRs 80 million was successfully completed within seven months. The  other most notable of the Interior project is the latest opus of the Firm: Interior Design of Nepal Bank Limited, Kathmandu Banking Office at Dharmapath, Kathmandu, Interior Design of the Chairmanâ€™s Office and Finance Department of NAC. Recently, the firm has successfully completed the Interior Design of Everest Bank Limited at Thamel, Surkhet and Tulsipur as well as Interior Design of International Leasing and Finance Company (ILFCO) at Chabahil, Kumaripati, Itahari, Butwal, Ghorahi .Suryabinayak, Kalimati and Narayangarh.
<br><br/>

The Consultant got involved in various interior projects of UNDP, Pulchowk,Lalitpur. The Consultant had successfully completed the Interior Refurbishment of Office Spaces located at West and East Wing at 2nd Floor of Main Building.  The design was achieved to be functional and low cost design by using locally available material. Similarly, another note worthy projects are interior design of Regional Center for Peace and Disarmament in Asia and the Pacific (RCPD), Project Office of UNDP; annex-IV and Office for Permanent Representative of Secretary General (OPRSG).   The firm has also achieved the turnkey project: Provision for Architectural/ Engineering & Construction Supervision Consultancy, BICC of UNMIN worth 29.95 million NRs designed and completed within seven weeks, which is record breaking performance in present contest of Nepal.
<br><br/>
Innovative approach, Integrity, Initiative, Originality and Independence are the chief characteristics of Green Design PVT. LTD.
<br><br/>
Seismic Resistant Design, Energy Efficiency, Efficient Use of Space, Cost Consciousness and Vaastu Shastra are the design philosophy of the firm. We believe that the success of a project depends not only on good design based on above-mentioned parameters, but also on preparation of accurate cost estimate (preliminary as well as detailed), precise BOQ, up to date as well as site specific rate analysis, condensed technical specification, strong bid document and efficient construction management.
<br><br/>
Last but not least, we would like to state that we prefer to do Studio work than being a factory of drawings. We enjoy doing less number of projects at a time emphasizing on quality.
